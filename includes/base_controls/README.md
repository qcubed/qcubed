# About `base_controls` directory

These are the core QCubed controls. Do not change them. If you want to override them, make your changes in the `qcubed/includes/controls` directory.

The "Gen" controls are generated by scripts found in the `assets/php/_devtools/jquery_ui_gen` directory. These scripts scrape the JQuery UI Web site to create a basic interface to accessing the JQuery UI controls. The "Base" controls provide additional enhancements to make the controls more QCubed friendly.
