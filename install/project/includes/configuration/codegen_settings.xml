                            add additional checks to make sure the data from the column is valid when reading, and also will
                            generate code that only updates the columns that have changed.

			<!--
					* "include" is used to override any "exclude" patterns or lists
					* "list" should be a  comma-separated list of table names
					* "pattern" is a regexp pattern
				So for example, if you only want to codegen any table prefixed with "qc_",
				you should set an excludeTables pattern to exclude all, or "[0-9a-zA-Z_]*".
				And then you should set an includeTables pattern of "^qc_[0-9a-zA-Z_]*".

				This feature allows you to use the comments made on the column of database table to be used as
				the label text generated for model connectors (used in form drafts as the text in front of the input control).
				If you do not want to use this feature, leave the delimiter as blank. Also, you cannot set it to be a whitespace (a sequence of space characters, or tabs or newlines); under such case, it behaves as if it has been left blank.

				Behavior (assumes "::" (without the quotes) as the character sequence used for delimiter):
					1. If you enable this feature but do not want to use the comment as the model connector label, make sure that you are not going to use the delimiter in the comment.
					   e.g. a comment like "The weight of the object" will not make use of this feature and your column property name will be used as the model connector label.
					2. In case you HAVE TO use the delimiter in the column comment, please prepend the comment with the delimiter. eg. a
					   comment like "The ratio (::) of weight to cost" will put the string "The ratio (" as the model connector label. To prevent this, write the same comment as ":: The ratio (::) of weight to cost".
					3. If the delimiter occurs multiple times in the comment on the column, only the part before the first occurrence is taken as the label for model conenctor (this also explains the behavior of the above point).

			<!-- Virtual Foreign Key Relationships -->
			<!--
				There are two ways to define relationships.  To signify a virtual FK
				relationship (for example, on foo.bar_id which would key to bar.id)
				you can:

				A) Simply define the relationship in the <relationships/> tag using
				   the following format:
					foo.bar_id => bar.id
					bar.other_id => other.id
					(with one relationship per line)
				   Note that because the relationships data uses a ">" symbol, proper
				   XML rules dictate that the content of the relationships script must
				   be escaped with <![CDATA[ and ]]> tags.

				B) You can define the relationships in totally separate relationships
				   script file by using the <relationshipsScript/> tag, where you can
				   specify a filepath and a format.  Format can either be:
					qcubed - follows the same "foo.bar_id => bar.id" as above
					sql - parses the script, looking for SQL-based ALTER TABLE statments like:
				    	ALTER TABLE foo ADD CONSTRAINT blah FOREIGN KEY (bar_id) REFERENCES bar (id);
